Walmart,Red Baron,5,"This pizza is AWESOME!! We've been so sick of paying an arm and a leg for take out pizza and have been trying different frozen pizza's to try and find something close to take out and this pizza hit the mark! The brick oven crust is perfect as long as you cook it right on the oven rack and the pepperoni is thick and spicy. We add a little more cheese, mushrooms, peppers, and onions and it is SO good. Its the crust that makes it so good though. So we'll be saving tons of money with no more take out..."
Walmart,Red Baron,4,"This product has always been a family favorite. We like the new crust and how quickly it cools. The ingredients are good, the only disappointment is the pizza itself has gotten smaller not sure why. All in all it is a good pizza for the price and convenience."
Walmart,Red Baron,4,Alot cheaper than other brands. Kinda spicy though as far as the pepperoni Goes. Not bad though
Walmart,Red Baron,4,This is good and fast to fix as a snack.
Walmart,Red Baron,4,Very good for a frozen pizza.
Walmart,Red Baron,5,I buy this for my grandson he love's pepperoni pizza this is his fav.
Walmart,Red Baron,3,It is alright but could be better just didn't have enough pepperoni
Walmart,Red Baron,5,One of the best forzen pizzas great price my family loves
Walmart,Red Baron,5,good product good pizza
Walmart,Red Baron,4,Red Baron pizza was very good
Walmart,Red Baron,5,"No doubt would recommend this to a friend. Price is reasonable and the flavor is great! Different even from the classic or fire baked version. Crust has more of a garlic flavor and it's close to ""hand-tossed"" thick. We don't enjoy thick crust. Walmart has them on special a lot. We try to always keep at least two on hand! Grandkids love them!"
Walmart,Red Baron,5,"For a quick evening meal that tastes great, this is the product.  We have baked and grilled and both ways taste great"
Walmart,Red Baron,5,These are THE only way to buy pizza if you are going frozen!! So good and don't taste like frozen or home cooked. The Mexican is THE best!!
Walmart,Red Baron,3,Ok.  Better off spending an extra dollar and getting a better brand
Walmart,Red Baron,5,Very thin and crispy crust!  Great peppering taste!  My son - a very picky eater actually prefers this one to any delivered pizza.
Walmart,Red Baron,5,We eat these all the time.  They taste great and you can't beat the price.
Walmart,Red Baron,2,"No consistency in the toppings.  Sometimes their pizzas have sauce and cheese....... and most times they are dry... very little sauce, cheese and pepperoni. No consistency in this product. Red Baron also has awful customer service!"
Walmart,Red Baron,1,"Would not buy again!  Bought this for my 5 yr old niece, who loves pizza. She was no impressed, did not even want a 2nd piece. After tasting, I discovered why, had very little flavor, very flat tasting. would not recommend."
Walmart,Red Baron,4,"My son loves this pizza.  He chooses it every time we go to pick out pizza!  If he is satisfied and will eat it, I'm happy!"
Walmart,Red Baron,3,"Crust tough.   I do not like this crust (my husband does, that's why I have to buy it). Ha! The crust is so tough it seems like cardboard. Hey, maybe there are more out there like hubby."
Walmart,Red Baron,5,My husband and son love them
Walmart,Red Baron,3,Pizza is okay but not for price
Walmart,Red Baron,5,Best one along with supreme.  Taste so good
Walmart,Red Baron,5,We really enjoyed this pizza.  It was yummy and we would definitely puchase it again.  And it was #free thanks to #BzzAgent!
Walmart,Red Baron,5,Love that they have microwave metallic to cook them on.  They don't have big enough bags for bigger families.  Taste amazing though.
Walmart,Red Baron,5,It's a great lunch snack
Sam's Club,Red Baron,5,"These cook evenly, have good flavor and good texture.  They are a nice size for a light meal or a heavy snack. They cook nicely in the toaster oven when following the oven directions. These come out to less than 99 cents per pizza and are clearly superior to the alternative in flavor, texture, and even appearance.  They are definitley a good buy."
Sam's Club,Red Baron,5,"Excellent! Not greasy, just yummy. Very well seasoned. Maybe a little spicy for kids under 5. My 6 & 7 year old love it. The youngest likes cheese and the rest of the fam likes pepperoni, so this keeps everyone happy."
Sam's Club,Red Baron,5,I love these.  They are so good.  Great to have when you don't feel like cooking
Sam's Club,Red Baron,5,Very easy to prepare.  2 minutes in microwave and you've got a meal.
Sam's Club,Red Baron,5,"Very good, especially for the price.  I see great reviews for these pizzas when they're microwaved. I've never had them cooked that way, but I imagine they would be great. We always cook them in the oven. They come out great. The crust is firm without being hard. They're a little on the saucy side. My husband doesn't like a lot of sauce, but he thinks they're okay. I like lots of sauce and wish they had a bit more. I can eat one with a few tots. He can eat 2 and some tots. At about $1 each, the quality is amazing for the price."
Sam's Club,Red Baron,5,fantastic pizza tastes like delivery only better just wish they had other flavors again used to get supreme and think it was triple meat now they only carry pepperoni and four cheese
Sam's Club,Red Baron,4,"I like that they are all separately sealed. We bring these to camp a lot and don't have to worry about cutting a large pizza in half to fit it in the fridge. Usually we add banana peppers, onions and extra mozz, but they are still good on their own."
Sam's Club,Red Baron,4,I always buy this product because my family enjoys it as a quick snack after sports and recreation games with friends
Target,California Pizza Kitchen,5,"The best style they make, in my opinion.  Add your own mushrooms, and a dash more mozzarella, and you have a masterpiece! Great with a glass of red wine."
Target,California Pizza Kitchen,1,"I realize frozen pizza can be hit or miss, but this one was a complete failure.  Nowhere near as good as the one served in the local CPK restaurant."
Target,California Pizza Kitchen,5,"This pizza tasted even better than the version I've had in CPK restaurants, and that's really saying something.  The price was decent too.  I highly recommend it if you  haven't tried it."
Walmart,California Pizza Kitchen,5,Best pizza ever.  I could eat this (and Mexican cuisine) every single dat!  Quick mom of 4 under 4 got to meal!
Walmart,California Pizza Kitchen,5,Best pizza I've ever had.  This stuff is the answer
Walmart,California Pizza Kitchen,4,"Tastes Italian! I'd you're going to eat grocery store pizza, this is a really good one. Sauce is Italian tasting, crust is thin and crispy, lots of cheese too!! Definitely worth a try!!"
Walmart,Digiorno,5,This was sooooooo G-oo-d GOOD IF U IS SHOPPING THEN BUY!!!!!!
Walmart,Digiorno,5,THIS IS THE BEST FROZEN PIZZA EVER. I HAVE ONE EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE SAUCE OR ANY OTHER INGREDIENT.
Walmart,Digiorno,5,"very happy they ship frozen pizza, again very thankful"
Walmart,Digiorno,5,"This is one of my hubby's favorite dinners. He really enjoys the flavor of this product. We feel like it is a good value for the money and Walmart seems to have the best deals on this brand most of the time. Way to go, Walmart!"
Walmart,Digiorno,5,closest to a pizza hut pizza and don't have to leave the house. Best tasting frozen pizza by far. End of discussion.
Walmart,Digiorno,5,Having a rising crust makes the pizza as good as ordering out. We do wish they could create a larger pizza. The current one seems the size of a medium.
Walmart,Digiorno,5,I love the original sauce - this pizza is my favorite!
Walmart,Digiorno,5,"My son loves pizza , since he started eating Digiorno we doesn't even want delivery pizza. I guess the advertising got it right on this one."
Walmart,Digiorno,5,Always better then take out and quick to cook at home.
Walmart,Digiorno,5,We love the rising crust - it tastes better than delivery.  Way less greasy!!
Walmart,Digiorno,4,"It's not delivery, it's digornio! Always been a fan of their pizza but lately I've found a new contender, WILD MIKES! Pick up a wild mikes pizza sometime and see how fresh and amazing it is, oh and it's a 2 pound pizza for 3-4$ but still, have to give credit where it's due, digornio will always be the king of frozen pizza no matter what, with freschetta being a close 2nd."
Walmart,Digiorno,3,Nothing special.  Definitely not a 5 dollar pizza.
Walmart,Digiorno,5,I like pizza and I love this pizza it has a great taste and it taste better than a pizza you buy from a pizza store. I would recommend this pizza to everybody.
Walmart,Digiorno,4,For the price of the DiGiorno pizza it's good!!
Walmart,Digiorno,4,"it was pretty good.  Didn't blow my mind, but it was good."
Walmart,Digiorno,5,This is the pizza I always buy for my kids when I don't have time to cook.  The taste is like fresh homemade pizza.
Walmart,Digiorno,4,I don't like a lot of pizza brands - only papa johns and this pizza tastes good to me - I like it has thick crust which tastes great
Walmart,Digiorno,3,"Was not impressed.  Not enough cheese, sauce, etc on the crust"
Walmart,Digiorno,5,The best frozen pizza I've found
Walmart,Digiorno,4,this is one of the best purchased pizzas to have on hand
Walmart,Digiorno,5,best store bought pizza
Target,Digiorno,2,"I only buy four cheese digiorno, The last one was awful. But It may be me. I kinda lost my taste for pizza. As I am growing older and only eat it a few times a year."
Target,Digiorno,5,"I've been buying Digiorno pizza for many years now, and it has never failed to meet my expectations! Perfect amount of sauce and cheese! This is the only pizza that doesn't make me feel sick.  "
Target,Digiorno,5,IT IS MY FAVORITE!!!! I EAT IT ALMOST EVRYNIGHT!!! BEST PIZZA EVERY MADE!!!!!
Target,Digiorno,2,Way to much cheese and not enough sauce. Also the cheese doesn't melt in the center of the pizza even after cooking it longer than directions say.  
Target,Digiorno,5,"i bought our first digiorno, 4 cheeses, about 3 years ago. And I tried delivery companies, new start ups, making our ow (even bought a round stone thingie). I wont buy another brand other than digiorno. Not one other. And when we have a party around the holidays, Digiorno (we're vegetarians) 4 cheeses plus all the other kinds (spinach, garlic etc) and meat ones fill the kitchen! I start baking around noon for the evening/weekend holiday party. Bring wine and beer I tell folks and we never stop. And there never is any pizza left. Folks take stuff home!!!! So I don't know what the rest of you guys complaining are eating or even if you're baking it right or you just got really old supermarket stuff. Sorry but that's just how it is with us.  "
Target,Digiorno,5,Have bought this for years and don't buy others anymore. To me the sauce is a huge deal. A couple of years ago DiGiorno introduced a new sauce. I hated it and started trying other brands. I was happy to see DG bring back the original sauce fairly quickly and I am happy again! Typically I only buy the 4-cheese when I buy frozen.
Target,Digiorno,5,"These are so good for a convenient pizza lunch, a good sized portion even if you have a healthy appetite. The cheeses are flavorful and balance out the fresh tasting and tangy tomato sauce.  "
Target,Digiorno,3,This is the first time I have tried DiGiorno. I was disappointed with the oversized crust and the saltiness. Otherwise it would have been very good.
Target,Digiorno,5,"We discovered Digiorno 4 cheese rising crust pizza through online taste test reviews a couple of weeks ago. My family has been very pleased with the product. We love the thick crust and tomato flavor of the sauce. We are also happy with the amount of cheese. Obviously, this is a frozen pizza so we have to recognize and review it for what it is. Of the frozen pizzas we have tried this is our favorite. And the price can't be beaten. In my area we have found it for $5 at two stores. It is hard to justify $25-30 for takeout pizza at our favorite local pizza restaurant now unless we really feel like splurging. I have already recommended this pizza to someone else. "
Sam's Club,Digiorno,5,What a bargain and not greasy like many pizza restaurants. We keep these in the freezer for nights when we don't want to cook. We add extra pepperoni from Sam's also.
Sam's Club,Digiorno,1,"They have fallen to the same fate as many other food items, they have fallen pray to the food shrink ray, to make the products size smaller, without substantially raising the price, of course this tactic is a still a price increase. We will not buy them anymore."
Sam's Club,Digiorno,5,My family loves this pizza.  Good Price.
Sam's Club,Digiorno,1,"You can forget those ads that said, ""Is it delivery, or is it Digiorno?"" because now there is absolutely no doubt--it's cheap, frozen pizza. Packaging is cheap, size is smaller, crust is TERRIBLE, cheese is rubbery, toppings chintzy. We used to buy one every other week (I used to add my own fresh toppings--even that didn't help this time!). I will NEVER buy another. So disappointed!"
Sam's Club,Digiorno,1,"I have never been a fan of store bought frozen pizza, but then I tasted DiGiorno thin and crispy pizza. I loved it. Decided I would try the rising dough....Bad decision! I bought three pizzas. I cooked them each individually and neither of them came out as advertised. The crust did not rise. It was more gooey than anything. Terribly disappointed because I was looking forward to a great experience. I don't think I am going to buy another one because I can't afford to keep wasting money trying to find a DiGiorno that actually has rising crust. Totally Disappointed!!!!"
Sam's Club,Digiorno,5,"My husband and I are empty nesters who cherish our Friday night routine: DiGiorno pizza and a beer at home every Friday night except when we're on vacation. We love our quiet evening together over a consistently delicious pizza. The DiGiorno team deserves a well-earned applause for producing such a delicious pizza. Thank you! As for the negative comments, just remember that people love to complain to an outside third party when they're actually frustrated for other reasons! You are amazing. Thank you for making us look so forward to Friday nights...as well as an occasional night in between,"
Sam's Club,Digiorno,2,"The photo on the box shows a pizza covered with cheese. The actual pizza - well not so much. See photo. The pepperoni on my pizza oozed oil out. The pepperoni in the box photo must be different or maybe they dabbed the oil off before taking the pic. Also, the sweet flavor of this pizza indicates there's a bunch of sugar in it. The dough was kind of gooey while the cheese was browning."
Sam's Club,Digiorno,4,"decent frozen pizza. I wait for these to go on sale ($3 off, usually) and I buy a few Something quick and easy to make."
Sam's Club,Digiorno,3,"We've had better.  Overall the pizza has decent flavor and the crust crisped up nice on the bottom, but I ended up using a papertowel to soak up the pooled grease on the top of each pizza before serving."
Sam's Club,Digiorno,5,"As always excellent!  I have purchased these pizzas twice here, and they are better than the pizzas from the restaurants.  I will continue to buy them!"
Sam's Club,Digiorno,5,"Excellent pizza, excellent price!  Best frozen pizza, tastes like pizza you would get at a pizza chain only served hot and fresh from home and at fraction of the cost"
Sam's Club,Digiorno,5,"Love it, great price"
Sam's Club,Digiorno,5,I bought this pizza 2 weeks ago and my kids loved it. Great for movie night or just one of those days you don't have time to cook. The pricing is also great #SingleMomApproved
Sam's Club,Digiorno,5,This pizza was delicious!
Sam's Club,Digiorno,5,The best pizza
Sam's Club,Digiorno,4,"Pretty sure it's only 2 meats.  I love the ""3-meats"" I usually buy from my local grocer, but every time I open it up, I never see the beef.  Only the sausage and pepperoni.  Misleading, much?"
Sam's Club,Digiorno,5,Bang for the buck!  We love the 3 meat pizza! Lots of cheese and toppings.  Great price for 3 from Sams
Sam's Club,Digiorno,5,"It is a very tasty pizza. It is a staple in our house for late night snacks or don't feel like cooking dinner. The crust is firm, the right amount of cheese and toppings and; since they went back to their original sauce, it is a perfect complement to everything."
Walmart,Jack's,5,"Love the crust!! Jack's Pizza is incredible!!! I was skeptical the first time I tried it, but wow, was I impressed. I love pepperoni and Jack's is one of the best. The crust is what sold me. I prefer thin crust pizza, and it doesn't get any better than Jack's. Why spend your money at the high priced pizza establishments when you can have Jack's..."
Walmart,Jack's,5,Great crust. Great toppings. Great price.  How can you go wrong? You can't.
Walmart,Jack's,5,this is the best pizza ever I can merch this is so amazing
Walmart,Jack's,5,I buy about 15 Jack's pepperoni pizzas per month...I love them so much I could live on just them! I notice that Nestle bought them awhile ago and was waiting for the changes and hoped there would be none. So far shrinking the size was disappointing and now the stores are gouging with the price. I hope I can continue to afford them in the future and perhaps Nestle can put pressure on them to stop it? It seems like only the promotional sales match the old reliable price anymore...people's incomes have not gone up!
Walmart,Jack's,3,"Friday night is pizza night in our house, and I'll settle for none other than the Jack's original thin crust pizza that I love. (Just ask my husband. I won't deviate from Jack's. Ever.) This pizza detective is more than a little disappointed. I'm certain you've switched the crust, but (sadly) I believe it is a Tombstone pizza crust. (I reject Tombstone solely because of the crust.) Please give me back my original Jack's crust or I'll be forced to (gasp!) explore other options. I love the true Jack's crust and want it back, please...PLEASE!"
Walmart,Jack's,5,Great pizza. All my wife and I buy are Jack's Pepperoni Pizza's. We have them for dinner and for a snack. We always bake a pepperoni pizza before we go out on Friday night. That way it is there waiting for us when we get home. It is the best after hours snack when you get home. Beer at the bar and cold pepperoni pizza when you get home with the munchies Life is good.
Walmart,Jack's,4,Great tasting for a great price.  Perfect for my kids.
Walmart,Jack's,4,For a quick snack and ok price it's a pretty good pizza
Walmart,Jack's,5,"I usually only by DiGiorno, but came across this brand I had never heard of and decided to give it a try for the reasonable price that was a lot less than DiGiorno. My husband and I were shocked at how really good this Pizza was. We love thin crust pizza that cooks up a little crispy, and just like the label says, it is real cheese and real pepperoni.... and you can tell it is just that. The cheese and pepperoni taste really come through. The tomato sauce they use is equally tasty and seasoned just right! We buy it all the time now. Follow their instructions exactly to bake it with perfect results. The size of the pizza isn't huge, but is enough for 1-2 people."
Walmart,Jack's,5,Love it… everyone should try this yummy pizza.. Great anytime
Walmart,Jack's,5,"I doctor it up with tomatos, onion, a little spagetti sauce, some olive oil and pepper flakes or pepper… incredible!!"
Walmart,Jack's,5,"or many years Iwas buying Tombstone pizza. All my relatives live in Wisconsin and this was my first introduction to pizza. I live in Arkansas and our stores didn't carry Tombstone. Eventually we did get them here and also Jack's. Both made in Wisconsin. And it was a little less expensive. So, after my purchase, I bought 3, I went home and cooked Jack'sfor supper that night. It was amazing!!! We all fell in love with Jack's . Have been buying it since and will continue to do so. I am a faithful customer to Jack's pizza. It's a little taste of Heaven to your taste buds!!!"
Walmart,Jack's,5,It's nice to have a non-traditional pizza flavor for a change.  It's so good I can eat the whole pizza!
Walmart,Jack's,5,"I hope they don't stop making this, cuz it's the best frozen Mexican style pizza at any price.  And I don't even like cilantro"
Walmart,Jack's,1,could not eat it one spice was so strong it overwhelmed all else
Walmart,Jack's,5,Hard to find Jacks mexican pizza… mixx the flavor!
Walmart,Jack's,5,"Of all the frozen pizza brands Jack's is the best tasting of all.  Of all Jack's pizzas, Mexican is at the top of my list.  Thin and crispy, just the right size, and just the right combination of flavors."
Walmart,Jack's,5,Are favorite pizza was the self rising bacon cheeseburger.  We don't buy many self rising yet we always look for a self rising bacon cheeseburger pizza when we do.  Sadly you seem to have taken that version off the market.   We like the thin crust bacon cheeseburger too yet it doesn't compare to it self rising counter part.  When we have people over we just put a pizza on the presto machine and it is great.   Right now we are very low on the pizza they are so good.
Walmart,Jack's,1,My pizza only had sauce on half and most of the toppings on one side
Walmart,Jack's,5,Having it two nights in a row!! Great crispy crust!!
Walmart,Jack's,5,We like the sauce because it never gives u heartburn.
Target,Tombstone,5,"Pepperoni is my familys favorite. Love the pepperoni. I think there was a Mexican pizza years ago (either that or taco), and those are usually our favorite kinds of pizza, but pepperoni is good as well.  "
Target,Tombstone,5,"I have tombstone pizza at least once a month, if not twice.  I love the convenience and the taste has not let me down"
Target,Tombstone,5,Best pizza in the freezer! Love the crispy crust and saucy slices.
Target,Tombstone,1,"used to buy Tombstone pizza all the time, but when they changed the cheese to the 5 cheese topping it is basically inedible.  Please change it back!"
Walmart,Tombstone,5,"I freaking love Tombstone Pizza!! It is my absolute favorite!! If you like frozen pizza, look no further!! Doesn't get any better than this!"
Walmart,Tombstone,5,"very delicious, and great portion size.  The toppings are ample, you don't have to supplement cheese or other items to cover the pizza like some other frozen ones"
Walmart,Tombstone,5,Best frozen pizza in the low price category
Walmart,Tombstone,4,Good for being a frozen pizza
Walmart,Tombstone,5,good eating. Quick snack or dinner
Walmart,Tombstone,4,just a good pizza
Walmart,Tombstone,5,This is a very good frozen pizza.  It had very good flavor to it.  We really liked it a lot.  The price was very good on it as well.  We cannot find it at our local grocery store that we shop at sometimes.  Thank you Walmart for having this pizza at your store.  We will continue to buy it.
Walmart,Tombstone,4,"For the cost and convenience, great quick fix meal.  Tasty and yum… even better than some of the more expensive brands."
Walmart,Tombstone,5,Great tasting.  My favorite frozen pizza.  Can taste the individual ingredients and comes up crispy crust each time.
Walmart,Tombstone,3,It is good
Walmart,Tombstone,3,It's not as good as the meat lovers or the cheese.  It's ok.
Walmart,Tombstone,1,Yuck.
Walmart,Tombstone,1,Not very good quality.
Walmart,Tombstone,5,Crust was crunchy.  Toppings were fresh!
Walmart,Tombstone,5,This is the only brand my family and I purchase.  It's good!
Walmart,Tombstone,5,"I really like this pizza, it's quick to heat and eat."
Walmart,Freschetta,5,"Freschetta Naturally Rising Crust Pizza is the BEST pizza on the market. My family loves the sauce, the cheese isn't oily like other brands, and the taste is fantastic. This is our personal favorite brand. We also love the rising crust. The crust is what makes a pizza and Freschetta has done awesome with their product."
Walmart,Freschetta,5,"Freschetta Naturally Rising Crust Pizza is the BEST pizza on the market. My family loves the sauce, the cheese isn't oily like other brands, and the taste is fantastic. This is our personal favorite brand. We also love the rising crust. The crust is what makes a pizza and Freschetta has done awesome with their product."
Walmart,Freschetta,5,This is the best tasting frozen pizza I've ever found. I have tried pretty much all the frozen pizza out there and I'm very critical on the sauces. This pizza has the best sauce on a frozen pie!
Walmart,Freschetta,5,Delicious and Fresh!  We love it!
Walmart,Freschetta,5,So good!! This is me and my husband favorite pizza from Freschetta. Everything down to the crust is delicious. We like to dip ours in ranch.E140
Walmart,Freschetta,5,"I almost never write reviews, so this is a big deal. Dare I say that I will now be buying this instead of Digiorno!?! I actually liked it better than most pizza places. It was hard for me to have just 2 pieces. My 3 kids all loved it too, and they are picky with their pizza. I have a few other kinds of this brand that I haven't tried yet so I can't speak to those, but I will definitely be buying more of the 4 Cheese variety."
Walmart,Freschetta,5,"This is my favorite Pizza. I like it better than some of the pizza places that are out their. I recommend Freschetta pizza's to all my friends and family. It has a nice rise to it. Just the right amount of cheese and sauce, and a fabulous taste. You can tell they used top quality ingredience in making their pizzas."
Walmart,Freschetta,4,"Wonderful version of the frozen cheese pizza... add your goodies to it and seasonings and it all comes out wonderfully full flavored and cheesy and soft, not hard as a rock!"
Walmart,Freschetta,5,"We really like this pizza, one of the better frozen pizzas and they use natural products"
Walmart,Freschetta,5,I love this pizza it is the closest I have found to pizza from a pizzeria!
Walmart,Freschetta,4,Good pizza.  The pizza is very good and easy to make.  My kids love it.  It is great when your late and need something quick
Walmart,Freschetta,5,love eating this pizza
Walmart,Freschetta,3,Good taste and good price
Walmart,Freschetta,5,I enjoy the flavor of the sauce used
Walmart,Freschetta,4, great tasting
Target,Freschetta,5,"Freschetta is my favorite frozen pizza brand. Four cheese is my favorite! If you are a cheese lover, then I recommend that you try this! The rising crust is soft (as long as you don't over cook it!) I recommend baking this at 350 degrees or 375 for 20 - 30 minutes! Keep your eye on it while in the oven and wait for the crust to be golden brown. It's a medium size pizza. The pizza is in a vacuum sealed heavy package that keeps it fresh. It's cheaper than ordering pizza out & you don't have to worry or wonder who is making your food.  "
Walmart,Tony's,5,Absolutely love these pizzas.  Great for the price!  Will definitley be purchasing more!
Walmart,Tony's,5,"For a very cheaply priced frozen pizza, my family and I really enjoy these.  Cook quick and save money on movie nights"
Walmart,Tony's,4,"it was really really great pizza!  Kids love them, and the crust is great!"
Walmart,Tony's,5,My kids love Tony's pizza.  I have to buy them four to six at a time
Walmart,Tony's,4,Good for its price
Walmart,Tony's,5,This is the Litte Ceasers of frozen pizza!  Great taste at a great price! You can feed a lot of people for very little money.
Walmart,Tony's,5,"Love grandchildren staying with me.  Yes, yes, they need to eat more regular meals BUT yes, they always talk me into getting the Tony's pizza"
Walmart,Tony's,5,Best frozen pizza ever.  The pizza is great if you make it right.  I love it!
Walmart,Tony's,5,"at only $2.50 each, these pies will feed a small army."
Walmart,Tony's,5,To me this is the best tasting pizza! The pizza is very crispy which is what I love and the ingredients are delicious. With two boxes it is enough for the whole family of five. It also has a great pizzeria style taste that anyone will love.
Walmart,Tony's,5,I feed these to my 3 sons when we are pressed for time.  They are good for the price.
